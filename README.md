# ParticleTrackingKalmanFilter

This is a code repository for my final project for CS281 Advanced Machine Learning. The goal of this project is to develop a particle tracking algorithm by modeling with a hidden Markov Chain and making a inference using Kalman filtering, and to compare this algorithm with other conventional algorithms. 

For more information, please see the final report (https://github.com/taebong/ParticleTrackingKalmanFilter/blob/master/CS281FinalProject.pdf)
